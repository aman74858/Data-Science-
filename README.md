<h2>üìäEXCEL DATA ANALYSIS FRO INDIA AND JAPANESE</h2> 

<h3>#Market Entry Analysis for ABG Motors in India</h3>

In this module, you will work on a case study and apply the concepts you learnt till now. You will learn how real data is manipulated and understand how the data science concepts are applied in real-life situations.
The case study given in this module is related to the automotive manufacturing sector. You have to assist a company to decide whether or not to enter the Indian market; this is done by analysing sample data over two major cities to understand the sales pattern. This will help you understand how data-driven decision-making can help you expand sales and achieve a minimum amount of revenue from the operations in the new country.

<b>Business Understanding</b><br>

This project is based on an example of ABG Motors, a successful Japanese car manufacturer, considering entry into the Indian market, seeks to confirm profitability similarities with Japan.
The company sees India as a key opportunity to expand its sales; it has been tracking the Indian market for over a few years. ABG Motors believes that the Indian market is quite similar to the Japanese market where the company currently operates. Before entering the new market, the company wants to be sure that the whole process will be profitable for them. Hence, you are given the task of ensuring the forecast of a minimum of 12,000 car sells over the sample data in one year.
Since you can‚Äôt analyse the entire Indian and Chinese markets, the company has asked you to analyse sample data from two major cities, one from each country, to understand the sales pattern; which can be named as ‚ÄúIndian Dataset‚Äù & ‚ÄúJapanese


The following results are expected at the end :
  1. A classification model over the Japanese data set estimates if an individual is likely to buy a new phone based on the provided attributes.
  2.Based on the learning in the module, justification should be provided for all the decisions made while building the model.
